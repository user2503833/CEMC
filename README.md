CEMC (Chinese Emergency Multi-modal Corpus) consists of two subsets: CEMC-WX (Chinese Emergency Multi-modal Corpus for Wechat) and CEMC-WB (Chinese Emergency Multi-modal Corpus for Weibo), corresponding to the files "wx_dataset_12162_20250408.pth" and "wb_dataset_15051_20250408.pth" in the folder respectively. The CEMC-WX-I, CEMC-WX-III, and CEMC-WB-I used in the experiment are not provided separately but are indicated in each data entry in the form of tags. For instance, if "is_dataset_1 == 1", it indicates that the data entry is from CEMC-WX/WB-I, and if "is_dataset_3 == 1", it indicates that the data entry is from CEMC-WX-III. The "wximg" and "wbimg" folders store the image files corresponding to each data entry in the CEMC-WX and CEMC-WB datasets respectively.
